This is the "Hamlib Segfault Honor Roll". hi.

The distinctive HSHR is granted to people who were able to make Hamlib 
issue segmentation faults (Bus errors and alike are valid too).
The HSHR can only be claimed on identified releases. 
A developer cannot apply for HSHR for segfaults on his/her own code.

Here is the list of the brave fellows:

* David Kjellquist WB5NHL, v1.1.3, 09/2002, kenwood/ts570.c
	caught on TS570D backend startup.

* Chuck Hemker N2POR, v1.1.3, 09/2002, src/event.c
	when using rig_set_trn() and receiving a SIGIO, 
	and having a second non serial rig open.

* Roeland Th. Jansen PA3MET, v1.2.10, 03/2010, tests/rigctl_parse.c
    $ rigctl
    Rig command: M
    Mode: ?

* Charles Suprin AA1VS, v1.2.12, 02/2011, all user programs/daemons
    $ rigctl -C MGP

* Chuck Ritola
