/*! \mainpage Hamlib API Reference

\section s1 Preface

This document describes the Hamlib library Application Programming Interface
(API) for this distribution.

We attempt to document the complete API of the core modules of Hamlib, i.e.
the API seen by end-user application developers.  You may navigate the
documentation through the tabs at the top of this page.

\note This documentation is a work in progress.

Please report any problems to hamlib-developer@lists.sourceforge.net.

\section s2 Typographic conventions

While Doxygen applies its own typographic conventions to the document based on
its own stylesheets, this section details Hamlib specific conventions.

\subsection sub1 Key words

Key words used in program source such as `TRUE` or `FALSE` are shown in a
constant width font.

\subsection sub2 Manual pages

References to Unix style manual pages are shown as `man`(1).  The manual page
entry is in a constant width font immediately followed by parentheses
containing a numeral denoting the section of the manual the key word can be
found.  For example, to view `printf`(3) use:

   ```
   man 3 printf
   ```

at a terminal prompt and the `man`(1) program will display the C library
manual page for the `printf()` function.  On most Unix type systems there are
two `printf` manual pages, one in section 1 (user commands) and the other in
section 3 (library calls).

To learn more about manual pages:

   ```
   man man-pages
   ```

is a good starting point.

If you are using a system that does not have manual pages, many HTML formatted
pages are available on the World Wide Web.
[The Linux man-pages project](https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/)
has many manual pages online and is the source for most system and library call
documentation found in every Linux distribution.  The
[Debian project also hosts a large collection of manual pages](https://manpages.debian.org/)
drawn from the packages in its distributions.

\subsection sub3 Program names and options

Program names and options to programs such as the Hamlib utilities are shown
in a constant width font, e.g. `rigctl -v` the *verbose* option to the `rigctl`(1)
Hamlib utility.
