 *  \brief Hamlib amplifier model definitions.
 *
 *  This file contains amplifier model definitions for the Hamlib amplifier API.
 *  Each distinct amplifier type has a unique model number (ID) and is used by
 *  hamlib to identify and distinguish between the different hardware drivers.
 *  The exact model numbers can be acquired using the macros in this file. To
 *  obtain a list of supported amplifier branches, one can use the statically
 *  defined AMP_BACKEND_LIST macro. To obtain a full list of supported
 *  amplifiers (including each model in every branch), the foreach_opened_amp()
 *  API function can be used.
 *
 *  The model number, or ID, is used to tell Hamlib which amplifier the client
 *  whishes to use. It is done with the amp_init() API call.

 *  be thought of as a hardware simulator and is very usefull for testing
