Status:	Being Overhauled.  Consider it broken.
	Temporary kludge to force compile (broke Hamlib!)

	The ts2k.[ch] are for the TS-2000.  I'm too lazy to spell it any
	different.

	Check back here often.  I've been making extensive changes daily
	(wife permitting).  I'll change the status to working as soon
	as I get reasonable functionality back.

	This file comes from my private copy of hamlib and not all
	changes will be made to hamlib's CVS.

	Let me know if you use any of this and find it works!  (It
	has been working well for me.)

File change summary:	(Hopefully, I'll keep this updated...)

	Makefile.am	Added ts2k.c, ts2k.h
	ts2k.status	current status in the form of rigctl help
			Takes a lot of time.  May or may not be kept
			up to date.  Anybody write an expect script?
	ts2k.c		New
	ts2k_menu.c	(not implemented; work to allow menus to set the
			zillions of options we'll never have functions for
			in hamlib.  The user and calling program will have
			to do all the work.  Comments will be much appreciated!)
	ts2k_menu.h	just the actual data and some structs for the rig.
			(Currently every menu item number and text is entered
			but the menu default is not set.  For example, grig
			can't be expected to know every rig's menu's.  in work!)
			It just occurred to me that it would be very nice to
			have a default hamlib menu.  If a rig don't have any
			or no menu functions yet, the levels and other items
			can be presented as a default menu.

	ts2000.c	Inserted my version.  mv'd orig to ts2000.c.orig
	ts2000.h	renamed ts2000.c to ts2000.h
	rigctl.c	Added comments: [# | ;] anything... [\n | \r]

// rig.h *NOT* modified in CVS!!!!
	include/hamlib/rig.h:	(nothing extraordinary.  yet.)
			added RIG_FUNC_ALL, RIG_PARM_ALL, RIG_LEVEL_ALL.
			added RIG_FUNC_EXCLUDE, RIG_PARM_EXCLUDE, RIG_LEVEL_EXCLUDE
			added RIG_RPTR_SHIFT_1750
			(The following needed work, though I stopped short of
			  what I wanted to do. )
			eliminated negatives for VFO, changed vfo_t to *ONLY*
			bitmasks, instead of bitmask and integer const.
			I'm going to check files and look for stuff that might
			get broken (mostly in the backends).
		The following are those I've checked manually:
			alinco/*.[ch]	// ok
			aor/aor.c	// I need to check RIG_VFO_VFO
			dummy/dummy.c	// "	"	"	"
			icom/*.[ch]	// ok
			kylix/hamlib_rigapi.pas	// same as rig.h (Hold the Press!)
			kenwood/	// ok
			pcr/		// ok
			src/		// ok
			tests/dumpcaps.c	// uses bitwise mask (&)
			yaesu/ft100.c	// uses RIG_VFO1 directly, etc...
			yaesu/ft817.c	// uses RIG_VFO1 directly, etc...
			yaesu/ft847.c	// uses RIG_VFO_MAIN, _CURR only!
